# HMDA-Loan-Demographics

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**:

This project tackles a critical issue in the Mortgage Banking industry â€“ ensuring fair and equitable access to loans for all qualified borrowers. By analyzing HMDA data, I have tried to identify potential biases and propose solutions like targeted outreach programs or loan product development to create a more inclusive lending landscape.


**BUSINESS CASE**:

How can we leverage HMDA data to identify and address potential disparities in loan approvals and loan amounts across different demographic groups, promoting fair lending practices in the Mortgage Banking sector?


**DATA SOURCE**: 

HMDA Mortgage Loan Database: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/

I collected data from the HMDA database for the year 2017. This data included the applicant's gender, race, ethnicity, loan amount, income, State, and other demographic details. 


**LIMITATIONS**:

The data source only contains data on approved loans, it does not have the rejected loans data which limits the analysis

The population data is provided in MSAMD context which is currently, I am yet to understand. This limits our understanding of the numbers in our analysis. 

The dataset also does not contain the ROI and creditworthiness data, which could be crucial factors in understanding fair lending practices.

**INSIGHTS**:


The average loan amount in 2017 is $197,000 with an average applicant income of $74,000, with a total of 885,742 loans taken in that year. 

Home Improvement loans are on average, a higher amount, followed by Refinance loans.

Conventional loans are more common, with a total of 623,671 loans taken in 2017. The average loan amount for Conventional loans is also higher($257,000), with these loans being taken by applicants with higher income levels ( Avg: $117,000)

FHA-insured loans are taken by applicants with lower income levels as indicated by an average applicant income of $74,000

While there are a higher number of loans in California across all demographics, the average loan amount is much higher on the East Coast, this could be due to higher housing prices. 

This disparity is not limited to Loans for Home Purchase. Average Loan amounts for  Refinance and Home improvement are also higher on the East Coast although their number is higher in California. 

Overall, loans are most concentrated in California on the West Coast, with New York, Connecticut, and Virginia taking most loans on the East Coast. 

Men received an average of 18.3% more in loan amount compared to women. This significant difference could be due to various factors, including income levels, loan applications types, or borrower qualifications.

Men also have a higher average income (21.2% more) than women. This income gap could partially explain the observed difference in loan amounts. 

Asians have the highest average loan amount ($370,000) and income ($131,000), followed by Whites with African Americans ($218,000, $88,000) falling in the final bracket. The income disparities explain the loan amount differences in these races. 

Native Hawaiian and American Indian communities have a much lower number of loans. This could be due to their respective lower population levels. 

Conventional loans seem popular across all races, particularly for Home Purchases. However, VA guaranteed loans are used for home improvement across most groups, potentially due to their potential for lower interest rates or relaxed credit score requirements.

A significant portion of Hispanic/Latino borrowers utilize FHA loans, which typically cater to those with lower credit scores or smaller down payments. 

Black/African American women have lower numbers(273) and lower Average loan amounts. This could be due to them falling in the lowest average income bracket($75,000). 

The data suggests potential loan amount disparities between racial groups. Further analysis is needed to determine if these disparities are due to income differences, creditworthiness, or other factors.



**RECOMMNEDATIONS**: 

Conducting a comprehensive review of the bank's lending practices to identify any potential biases based on gender or race. This review could involve analyzing loan application data along with approval/denial rates across demographics.

Implementing mandatory fair lending training for loan officers to ensure awareness of potential biases and promote consistent lending practices for all qualified applicants.

Developing loan products specifically tailored to the needs of borrowers with lower income or credit scores.

Developing targeted outreach programs to educate and encourage loan applications from underserved communities, particularly Black/African American women and Hispanic/Latino borrowers. 

Targeted marketing campaigns in other States on the West Coast, Mid-West, and Central USA. 

Advocating for policies that promote affordable housing on the East Coast (specifically Massachusetts).
